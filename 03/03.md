## Background

### CSS Flexbox
The Flexbox module allows you to design flexible responsive layout structures. In this class, we will mostly be applying Flexbox properties for the parent element.

### Parent and child elements
The terms ```parent``` and ```child``` are used to describe relationships between HTML elements. We can see this through an example below.

``` html
<div>
  <p>Hi this is my webpage.</p>
</div>
```
In the example above, the ```div``` is the parent and the ```p``` is the child.

``` html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>Home</li>
    <li>Programs</li>
    <li>About</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
In the example above, we have multiple parent-child relationships. The ```nav``` is the parent to the ```ul``` (and the ```ul``` is child to the ```nav```). The ```ul``` is the parent to the ```li``` (and the ```li``` is child to the ```ul```).

When we use CSS Flexbox, we will use flexbox properties for the parent element of the elements we want to move. If we want to move the ```li``` elements, we apply flexbox to its parent, the ```ul```. If we want to move the ```ul``` element, we apply flexbox to its parent, the ```nav```.

## Exercises

Today will be a day of practicing flexbox. The instructor will give each person a website wireframe. Students should try to code that design and show it to the instructor for approval. If approved, students earn a point for their team and receive another wireframe.
